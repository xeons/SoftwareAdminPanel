# Software Admin Panel
A protected software administration front-end and API written in PHP.

This script was written for managing paid software authorization. The software would often times prompt for a login, and then check for authorization to run. The programs would often periodically ping the API and verify the software was still authorized to run.
The software was built primarily for affiliate programs, which is why there is a link tracking section.

This script makes use of the Smarty templating engine.
